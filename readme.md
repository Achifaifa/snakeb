#Snake B

A snake attacks a campsite. But it's not a regular snake...

Inspired by B movies, this game lets you control a muntant, quantum morphing two-headed snake (which 
may or may not be a cyborg spawned in a secret government project).  

Press any key (wasd/ijkl) to start moving. 
Space: Spawn a child snake that will eat small victims

to rejoin the child snake with the main one, just drive one into the tail of the other. Once
joined and while there is only one snake on play, both controls (wasd/ijkl) will work just the same.

Large enemies (8) can only be eaten by the main snake, while small enemies (o) can only be eaten 
by the child snake. 

The environment also has obstacles you should avoid, like tents(A), rocks(#) and the main 
character(@), all of which will kill you on the spot.
